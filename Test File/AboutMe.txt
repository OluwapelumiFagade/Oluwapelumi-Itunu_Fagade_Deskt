My name is Oluwapelumi Fagade, A computer scientist, a husband and a private Transport entreprenuer. Recently I became more passionate about software testing because of how important it is in the software developing world and maybe because of my knack for a perfect product that gives 100% customer satisfaction. I was born and bred in Oyo state,  the big city of Ibadan precisely and I am the 3rd child in the family of 5. Professionally, I have always shuffled between sales and customer satisfaction business in the I.T world, and now I believe it's high time that i started doing something more important like being an integral part of software software developing. I am not a man of many words so I'll stop here. I beleive you will know more about me if you are lucky enough to meet in person. A lot of my Ex colleagues say I am an amazing person to work with or even have as a friend, which is why i believe my network of friends keeps shooting the roof and cuts accross quite a number of profession and race all around the world. Let me give you some heads up, I can be very boring and reserved in a new environment, so you may not be able to tell much about me on the first meet. ciao
